## üî¨ Key Components

### Thesis Work
- See **`thesis.pdf`** for the full explanation of the methodology, dataset preparation, model training, and results.

### Dataset Fabrication
- Folder: **`1PGB fabrication/`**
- Contains scripts to process MD trajectory files and generate the dataset of contact maps over simulation time.

### Neural Network Model
- Trained a **Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN)** to learn the time-dependent evolution of contact maps.
- Results are saved in **`risultati 1PGB/`**.

### Monte Carlo Simulation
- Wrote a Monte Carlo script that predicts the contact map at any given time step based on learned statistics.
- Results are saved in **`Risultati Montecarlo/`**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

To run the scripts in this repository you‚Äôll need:

- Python 3.x
- [GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org/) (for MD simulations, optional if you only use the dataset)
- Python packages:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scipy`
  - `keras` or `tensorflow`
  
Install the Python dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy tensorflow
```

## üîó Acknowledgments
- Simulations performed using GROMACS.
- Neural network models developed using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Protein: 1PGB.
